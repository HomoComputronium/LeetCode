1. loop and get trust[0] list -> trustingList.doesNotContain(judge)
2. loop and get trust[1] list -> trustedList.contains(judge);

3. get initial candidate list >>> trustedList.forEach(trusted -> {
    trustingList.doesNotContain(judge)

})

4. Check if every candidate satisfied two conditions:
    1. everbody ( range(1 to n).exlude possible judge) trusts judge - all combinations arr{nonJudge, judge) are present in the town
