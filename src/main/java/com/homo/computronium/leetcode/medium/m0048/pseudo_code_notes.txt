Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

1. Starting from x = 0, y = 0 move the cell to rotated state
2. Remember previous and rotate it next -> do it 4 times
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with the cell x = 1, y = 0 and repeat step 3 till y = len - 1 (prelast cell)
4. Repeat step 3 with x + 1 y + 1 (next row, cell diagonally)



1 2
3 4

0 0 -> 0 1

0 1 -> 1 1

1 1 -> 1 0

x becomes y
y becomes x = len - y
